I am a neuroscientist trying to use my brain to study how the brain functions. 

I hold a PhD in Behavioural Neuroscience and a Bachelor in Psychology from University College London, and an MPhil from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London. 

After spending a decade in London, UK, I return to my home country and now live in Shanghai, China.
