I am trying to use my brain to study how the brain functions.

I received my B.S.degree in Psychology from University College London (2014) and an MPhil in Experimental Neuroscience from Imperial College London (2015). Before I started by PhD training with Prof. Kate Jeffery, I was a visiting graduate student at Harvard University (2016). 

Recently, I received my Ph.D. degree in Behavioural Neuroscience from University College London (2021), where I found two distinct 'compass' systems for spatial orientation in the rat brain. 

After a decade spent in London, UK, I have returned to my home country, China. I am currently conducting a postdoctoral research with Dr Ninglong Xu the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ION) in Shanghai.
