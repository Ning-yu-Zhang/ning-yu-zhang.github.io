I am trying to use my brain to study how the brain works.

I received a BSc degree in Psychology from University College London (2014) and an MPhil in Experimental Neuroscience from Imperial College London (2015) in the UK. Before I started by PhD training with Prof. Kate Jeffery at UCL, I was a visiting scholar at Harvard University (2016) in the US. 

I recently received the Ph.D. degree in Behavioural Neuroscience from University College London (2021), where I found two distinct neural 'compass' systems for spatial orientation in the rodent brain,encoding local and global directions in symmetric environments.  

After a decade spent in London, UK, I returned to my home country, China, for a postdoctoral research with Dr Ning-long Xu at the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. I aim to understand how rodents and nonhuman primates monitor and make flexible decisions and the underlying neural circuit mechanisms. 

I occasionally teach topics in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology.
